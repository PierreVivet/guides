## Open Data

Open data is data that is freely available and anyone can _access, reuse, and share_ it.

The following points are characteristic of open data:

* The data becomes usable by being available in a common understandable format.
* The data must be available under an open license. This allows anyone to use, redistribute and modify it.

Open data can help governments, businesses and individuals. It can improve services, bring socioeconomic changes, and protect the planet.

#### Open Data licences

There is not only 1 open data philosophy. It can be seen through the open data licences which are divided in two main types : public domain or attributive licences, and contributive licences.

* Public domain/attributive licence : there is no restriction in the use of the data, for personal as well as commercial uses. Everyone is free to do what he wants with the data. Within this category we can find Open License, Public Domain, CC0, CC-by, Open Data Commons Attribution License...
* Contributive licence : here the word 'open' means that we can't use the data and keep them for ourself in a commercial product; every improvement made to the data needs to be published back as open data, that's why they are sometimes called 'viral licences'. Those licences are ODbL, OSM, CC-by-sa.
