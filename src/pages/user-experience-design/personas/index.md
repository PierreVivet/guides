## Personas
Personas are archetypes representing a group of persons who share similar goals, behaviours, motivations. They are often used in marketing or informatics. They are tools for developers and projects managers to stay centered in the satisfactions on end-users needs. The realism of the personas are a key feature to stay focused on what the users can and will do with the product.
The synthesis of users behaviours can help designers to understand if the product they thought of can satisfy all users or if it's necessary to create different products for different end-users.
